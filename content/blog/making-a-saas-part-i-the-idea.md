So for a long time now I have the idea of creating a SAAS. At least to try. I want to make a simple app with some Monetizable features. 

My idea is to make a simple Journaling / Planner App, something simple with a calendar. The app should be a Web app and be accessible on all devices. There are tons of apps like this which I myself use daily like, [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/) or [Daylio](https://daylio.net/), but this is just a subset of the fatures I really need and focused just on one thing. Some extended feature would be a "scrap book" feature where you could add different media like, pictures, links, maybe audio files? and "stick" them on the page however you like, but that is something far far away for now. 

The technologies I want to try for this project is [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/) with [Prisma.js](https://www.prisma.io/) and still figuring out what DB to use. Maybe just a simple postgresDB? For the UI I will try [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Anyway, I will probably pivot a lot of things during the development. I should also write a trello board and plan a rough sketch of things I want to have and what would be a MVP feature.
