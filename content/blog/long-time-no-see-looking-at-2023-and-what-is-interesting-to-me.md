Web development is constantly evolving and new technologies and tools are being introduced all the time. One of the latest trends in web development is the use of Vite, Astro, and Server-side rendering React. In this blog post, I will use openAI to generate a blogpost talking about those technologies I would really want to tackle this year. 


#﻿# Vite

Vite is a build tool and development server for JavaScript projects. It is built on top of the native ES modules feature in modern browsers and is focused on providing a fast and efficient development experience.

One of its main features is that it uses the native ES modules feature in modern browsers to provide a fast and efficient development experience. Instead of using a bundler like Webpack or Rollup, Vite allows you to run your code directly in the browser using the native ES modules feature. This means that you don't have to wait for the bundler to rebuild your code every time you make a change, which can significantly speed up the development process.

Vite also includes a development server that automatically reloads the page when changes are made to the code. This means that you don't have to manually refresh the page every time you make a change. Additionally, it has a plugin system that allows you to add additional functionality to your project, like transforming your code with Babel or Typescript.speed up the development process.

##﻿ Astro

Astro is a framework for building web applications using React and GraphQL. It is designed to make it easy to build fast, efficient, and dynamic web applications by providing a set of powerful tools and libraries for working with React and GraphQL. Astro provides a set of higher-order components and hooks that make it easy to work with GraphQL, and also includes a built-in development server that allows you to run your application locally and see your changes in real-time.

#﻿# React & SSR 

Server-side rendering React is a technique for rendering React components on the server. This allows you to create fast and efficient web applications that load quickly and provide a smooth user experience. Server-side rendering React allows you to pre-render your components on the server, so that when a user requests a page, they receive a fully-rendered HTML page instead of just an empty page that needs to be populated with data. This can greatly improve the performance of your web application, especially on slower internet connections or for users with low-end devices.

#﻿# Conclusion

N﻿ot that satisfied with what the AI generated. I ofc did not go into too much detail with it, but I wanted to see what does the AI thinks about these trends  and it in the end just bare bones and nothing too much of substance.
