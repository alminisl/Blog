The end of the year again.. As this pandemic raged thru the year too I must say my profesionall life was not that much affected, luckily. I had a great time working on interesting projects. Got more indepth with TS and ESRI tech stack, worked on my mentoring skills, met new colleagues and made huge progress understanding some design decisions and in general improvements of my understanding of software. 



Some of the lowlights this year were the traveling complications for sure. Working from home is a double-edged sword. For one you get the benefit of working from home and having a bit of more free time, but then again you never use the freetime as you can work more ofc why should you not just finish one more PR? Then going back to the office its much easier to "Disconnect" from the work mindset as at home.. so this is something I will probably struggle a bit more in the future I suppose. 

Can't complain too much tho, I did a bit of traveling this year, from visiting home town of Visoko, to going to Rovinja and Antalya, visiting some Austrian places like Salzburg and the moutains of Bad Gastein. There was a healthy mix of everything. \

All in all, I hope that 2022 will be as eventfull as 2021 and that its a nice year to start some more projects and learning new technologies. Currently I'm eyeing Rust and IOT things. We will see if that ends up on here.
