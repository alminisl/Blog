I wanted to make a "new years" resolution on the things I would like to learn and use the next year. 

I will however start with a list of things I did in 2021. 

For example in 2021 I worked mostly with: 

- React 
- Typescript
- Nodejs
- BlitzJs
- MobX 
- MS Azure
- JohnnyFive.js
- Docker 
- Unity3D

I really like the tech stack I had to work with in 2021. Mostly JS based as I'm working as a Frontend dev in my day job, but I also did a lot of IOT side projects(some of them can be found on this blog) with JohnnyFive.js. 

At the end of the year I discovered Blitz.JS and I love it. I started a small side project with Blitz.js and I can't believe I've worked on projects without it, makes development so much nicer, with a lot of things out of the box. For example, you have already hooks for login / sign up, database ORM setup with Prism.js.. so nice. 

What I also did a lot this holiday season is working with my personal Home Server and Docker, where I setup a lot of apps using Docker and configured it to have a nice media center at home.  

Technologies I want to learn in 2022: 

- GraphQL
- Rust
- Docker
- Devops in general
- Kubernetes and Terraform
- Tailwind

I really want to dive in more Deeply into Devops this year. I did a lot of those things in the past with past jobs but the ecosystem has changed a lot since then. Kubernetes and Terraform are now the go to technologies for Devops. 
Also a good language I to learn would be Rust, however with Rust I just miss the use case as to when to use it. 

Tailwind is something I started to use on some side projects and I really love it. You just write down your css classes and you build your layouts and designs however you want. Preferre it much more to alternatives like bootstrap. 

One thing I have used a little bit is GraphQL and I would really love to use this a bit more in my work and also privately. 

So this is a small list of things I would love to learn / use this year.. Probably will not get into everything on the list here, but I would love to re visit this at the end of the year and see what of those I can cross out.
