An easy way to **dockerize** your React (create-react-app) would be like this:

- Add this as a dockerfile into the root of your project. 

```bash
# pull official base image
FROM node:13.12.0-alpine

# set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# add `/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH
ENV PATH /app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# install app dependencies
COPY package.json ./
COPY package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
RUN npm install react-scripts@3.4.1 -g

# add app
COPY . ./

# start app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```


- Add a docker ignore file
```bash
node_modules
build
.dockerignore
Dockerfile
```

This will speed up the Docker build process as our local dependencies inside the “node_modules” directory will not be sent to the Docker daemon.

- Build the docker image 
`$ docker build -t dockerized:react .`

Then start the contianer when the build is done: 
```bash
$ docker run \
    -it \
    --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/app \
    -v /app/node_modules \
    -p 3001:3000 \
    -e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true \
    dockerized:react
```

So whats happening here ? 

- The docker run command creates and runs a new container instance from the image we just created.
- `-it` starts the container in interactive mode. We need to use this, because the of the react-scripts, which exit after they are finished (if the scripts exits so does the process and so does our Docker container). To prvent that we use the `-it` command which lets us stay in the console.

- `--rm` removes the container and volumes after exiting our container
- `-v ${PWD}:/app` mounts the code into the container at “/app”

- Since we want to use the container version of the “node_modules” folder, we configured another volume: `-v /app/node_modules`. You should now be able to remove the local “node_modules” flavor

- `-p 3001:3000` exposes port 3000 to other Docker containers on the same network (for inter-container communication) and port 3001 to the host


- `-e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` enables a polling mechanism via chokidar so that hot-reloading will work
