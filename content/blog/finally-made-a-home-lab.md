Finally got the time to setup my Home lab, which I always wanted. I have a Synology NAS bay and 2 RPis (3 and 4) and I finally got some time to make a project out of them. Will make a detailed post about it, but currently I only use it for Sonarr / Radarr and Pi-Hole. 

Was an interesting little project over the weekend, freshened up some of my networking knowledge, where I learned that I can't have 2 IP addresses port forward with the same port. Who knew? 

Anyway, glad its working, here is a image of how the Dashboard looks like for all the self hosted apps:
