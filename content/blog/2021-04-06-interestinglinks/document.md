I thought about this for a time now, to just share interesting things I find on the web which caught my eye. This is mostly for me personally to have a backlog of interesting links I can access when I need but maybe someone else will find it interesting too.

So to begin with one of the most interesting topics and links you can find on the internet, at least in my opinion, are the kind where a big company explains some technical things they did to improve something on their product / app.

This week - [How we scaled the GitHub API with a sharded, replicated rate limiter in Redis](https://github.blog/2021-04-05-how-we-scaled-github-api-sharded-replicated-rate-limiter-redis/)

It explains how in github they had an issue with Redis rate limiter, read for more information you won't regret it!

Next up is a super nice tool which is PERFECT for people with 0 design sense but they need an Icon or some svg's on their website. As I currently work on a Landingpage this website is a godsent - [Undraw](https://undraw.co/)

Synopsis

```
Create better designed websites, products and applications.
Browse to find the images that fit your messaging, automagically customise the color to match your brand and use it as a normal image,
embedded code or directly in your design workflow.
```

Last link for this week is this obscure website I found and specifically this blogpost about remote tools (Which idea I will totally steal.. I mean get artistic inspiration) - [9 Tools You Need to Optimise Your Remote Workflow](https://cult.honeypot.io/reads/9-tools-you-need-to-optimise-your-remote-workflow)

And the meme of the week goes to the annoying Pythong developer friend we all have..
